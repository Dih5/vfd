VFD (Vernacular Figure Description) is a JSON-based description system for plots. It aims to describe *what* needs to be
plotted, while *how* it is done is decided when the files are opened. This allows to generate a set of files describing
the plots, which can latter be batch-processed to produce a consistent set of figures.

Also check http://github.com/dih5/vfd/tree/master/external for tools to use it from other applications.


* Free software: LGPLv3+
* Documentation: https://vfd.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------
* While version<1.0.0, minor releases will mean API compatibility is broken.
* CLI and python package to plot the files with matplotlib.
